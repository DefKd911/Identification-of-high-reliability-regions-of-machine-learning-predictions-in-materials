1) analysis of ML results by construction of a convex hull in feature space that encloses accurately predicted systems can be 
used to identify regions in feature space for which ML predictions are highly reliable.
2) analysis of the systems enclosed by the convex hull can be used to extract physical understanding and 3) 
materials that satisfy all well-known chemical and physical principles that make a material 
physically reasonable are likely to be similar and show strong relationships between the properties 
of interest and the standard features used in ML.
3)We also show that similar to the composition
structure-property relationships, inclusion in the ML training data set of materials from classes 
with different chemical properties will not be beneficial and will slightly decrease the accuracy of 
ML prediction and that reliable results likely will be obtained by ML model for narrow classes of 
similar materials even in the case where the ML model will show large errors on the dataset 
consisting of several classes of materials.

 
 Our work suggests that analysis of the error distributions 
of ML predictions  will be beneficial for the further development of the application of ML methods 
in material science.
